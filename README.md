# Accounting-App
This app can be used to track income and expenses made by the user in a month
It shows total income and expenses and the percentage of each expence on the total income.
It is also flexible as it allows the user to delete items entered.
{{{I would like to further add the date of an item to the description of an entry, giving the user an opportunity to enter the date a transaction happened
And also would move the outstanding balance into the next month while clearing everyother thing
Also would give the user an opportunity to decide when to carry over balance and start a new "month", this could be bi-weekly or weekly}}}
